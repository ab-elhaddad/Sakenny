## My Graduation Project *(Currently working on it)*
#### An Application For Reserving Residential Spaces which aims mainly on helping students that study away from their homes to find a place to stay in by offering them 3 options of sapces (Bed - Room - Apartment). We are aiming to provide variety of options for each student so they can find the most suitable space for them.

*The code included in this repository is the implementation of the backend server whose APIs should be used in a Flutter application.*
#### You can use the APIs through:
- https://sakkeny.onrender.com <sub>(More Stable)</sub>
- https://sakkeny.vercel.app/
- #### You can find the documentation of all the APIs and how to use them [here](https://sakkeny.onrender.com/api-docs/). And for the full documentation of the whole project and its features [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/138ADnx4zKEdunJ2MMos9pp5aP6m1Phle/view?usp=sharing).

1. **Node.js** (As a runtime environment)
2. **TypeScript** (As the Development language)
3. **JavaScript** (As the Deployment language)
4. **Express.js** (For handling with HTTP connections)
5. **PostgreSQL** (As the project DBMS)
6. **Render and Vercel** (As a Hosting site for the Backend code)
7. **Microsoft Azure** (As a container for DB)
