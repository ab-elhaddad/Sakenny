## My Graduation Project *(Currently working on it)*
#### An Application For Reserving Residential Spaces which aims mainly on helping students that study away from their homes to find a place to stay in by offering them 3 options of sapces (Bed - Room - Apartment). We are aiming to provide variety of options for each student so they can find the most suitable space for them.
